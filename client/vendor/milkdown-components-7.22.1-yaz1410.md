# Milkdown components patch (CSS zoom, list-item caret restore)

`milkdown-components-7.22.1-yaz1410.tgz` is a version-pinned build of
`@milkdown/components@7.22.1` with two fixes:

- YAZ-1410: table drag preview, drag-over, and boundary indicator geometry are
  correct when the editor is inside a CSS `zoom` context.
- YAZ-2131 4B: the list-item node view restores the caret once per editor view
  per frame instead of once per list item. Opening a note with N bullets used to
  run N whole-plugin transactions in one frame (22.6 s for a 5k-line note). The
  caret still lands where the last of those N restores put it. Drop this hunk
  once upstream Milkdown releases the same fix.

The package name and version remain unchanged so every Milkdown package uses
the same 7.22.1 dependency graph.

When updating an existing checkout, use `npm ci` to install the locked archive.
Because the package version is unchanged, `npm install` can retain an already
installed upstream copy. `client/src/editor/tableZoom.test.ts` checks the actual
installed runtime and catches that stale installation, as does
`client/src/editor/listItemCaretRestore.test.ts`.

The upstream package is MIT licensed and includes its original `LICENSE` file.

Upstream npm integrity:
`sha512-6IA8fcFcBTm/x1X1typz73yUoT1JuN4srmifGAIeWEtCnayEwRjFxpQOoQrfvMgBYx4DSHcPVLhJUlR/xbBtxg==`.

Rebuild from the pinned registry artifact:

```sh
node tools/buildMilkdownPatch.mjs components
```

For an offline rebuild, pass the unmodified upstream npm archive:

```sh
node tools/buildMilkdownPatch.mjs components --source /path/to/components-7.22.1.tgz
```

The build verifies the entire upstream archive against its pinned integrity, then
applies the adjacent readable `.patch` with Git. It fails if the source has drifted.
Use `--output /path/to/rebuilt.tgz` to compare a rebuild without replacing the vendor archive.
Only these files differ from upstream:

- `src/table-block/dnd/preview.ts`
- `src/table-block/dnd/drag-over-handler.ts`
- `src/table-block/view/pointer.ts`
- `lib/table-block/index.js`
- `src/list-item-block/view.ts`
- `lib/list-item-block/index.js`

The stale table-block and list-item-block source maps and their `sourceMappingURL`
lines are removed because the compiled runtime is patched directly. No exports or declarations change.
