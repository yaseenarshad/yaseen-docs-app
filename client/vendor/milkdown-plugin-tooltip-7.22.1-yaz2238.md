# Milkdown tooltip patch (a throttled update never skips a real change)

`milkdown-plugin-tooltip-7.22.1-yaz2238.tgz` is a version-pinned build of
`@milkdown/plugin-tooltip@7.22.1` with one fix:

- YAZ-2238: `TooltipProvider` throttles its updates (20 ms for Crepe's floating toolbar). The
  throttle's trailing call carries only the LAST call's `prevState`, and the provider skipped any
  update whose state equalled that `prevState`. So an update that should have hidden the toolbar,
  followed inside the window by a transaction that changed nothing, was skipped whole — and the
  toolbar stayed on screen for a selection that no longer existed (seen after ⌘Z, where it covered
  the row above and kept the block handle off it). The provider now also remembers the state its
  last EVALUATED update saw, and skips only when the state matches both. It can only ever evaluate
  more often than upstream, never less. Drop this patch once upstream Milkdown releases the fix.

The package name and version remain unchanged so every Milkdown package, `@milkdown/kit` and
`@milkdown/components` included, resolves the same patched 7.22.1 through the root npm override.

When updating an existing checkout, use `npm ci` to install the locked archive; `npm install` can
keep an already installed upstream copy. `client/src/editor/tooltipThrottle.test.ts` runs against the
installed runtime and fails on the upstream copy.

The upstream package is MIT licensed and includes its original `LICENSE` file.

Upstream npm integrity:
`sha512-drdWA/7WlrDr2B+ABYf4tY9xTiwg/CJMUCydfD05dR2d8wOkaF6oOHZwJbWnkWLMtAJWdieOYgfXGPhQRwXxCg==`.

Rebuild from the pinned registry artifact (the same pipeline as the components patch):

```sh
node tools/buildMilkdownPatch.mjs plugin-tooltip
```

For an offline rebuild, pass the unmodified upstream npm archive:

```sh
node tools/buildMilkdownPatch.mjs plugin-tooltip --source /path/to/plugin-tooltip-7.22.1.tgz
```

The build verifies the whole upstream archive against its pinned integrity, then applies the
adjacent readable `.patch` with Git, and fails if the source has drifted. Use
`--output /path/to/rebuilt.tgz` to compare a rebuild without replacing the vendor archive.
Only these files differ from upstream:

- `src/tooltip-provider.ts`
- `lib/index.js`

The stale `lib/index.js.map` and its `sourceMappingURL` line are removed because the compiled runtime
is patched directly. No exports or declarations change.
