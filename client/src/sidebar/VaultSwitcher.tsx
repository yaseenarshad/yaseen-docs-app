/**
 * The sidebar header's vault switcher (YAZ-1767): GitHub Desktop's repository panel, keyboard-first.
 * The header's top-left button is the trigger — bold vault name plus a small chevron (D6) — and the
 * panel it drops is a `ContextMenuSurface` hung off the header's own rect (D5), flush with the
 * sidebar and at least as wide — wider when a name needs it, so no name is ever cut (YAZ-1974 D7).
 * Its first element is the filter input, autofocused, query reset on every open (D7);
 * below it every vault as ONE line — name, then relative time (YAZ-1974 D2) — the CURRENT
 * vault included and marked `aria-current` (D3); and LAST, under a hairline, "Open folder…" — the
 * folder picker (D4), which opens the picked folder beside like a vault row does (YAZ-1914
 * amended D4 — it was in place). Two vaults can share a name, so the full path is one hover away:
 * a row's ⓘ, shown while the row is hovered, draws the WHOLE path wrapped at its slashes in a
 * tooltip portalled to <body> — the panel's scroll box never clips it. Mouse-only, by design.
 *
 * Two groups (YAZ-2555 D1): the vaults that have a window stand first, under a small "Open" label;
 * then a hairline and "Not open". The labels are not rows — never focused, never highlighted. The
 * rows (A1) are the recents, plus every open vault (`openVaultRoots` over the cache's windows),
 * plus every vault that has a number: each group is the recents in last-used order, then — with no
 * time, they have none — "Open" the open vaults that fell out of the recents, "Not open" the
 * numbered ones, in number order. A numbered row wears its key, `⌘<n>`, between the name and the
 * ⓘ (D4), always: ⌘<n> works with the panel up or down, so nothing is held to see it.
 *
 * ONE rule for every vault row (D1/D3): activating it — click or ⏎ — asks main's one open-recent
 * door, `window.openRecent(path)`, which brings that vault to the front: its open windows raised
 * (D9) or, with none, a NEW window on its remembered last file (D2) — and bumps the MRU either
 * way; the current vault's row simply raises this window. A folder that is gone answers `false`:
 * the row is disabled with "Folder not found" in the time slot and the panel STAYS open
 * (Welcome's behaviour), so the next choice is one keystroke away. `true` closes the panel.
 *
 * Names (YAZ-1974 D4): the trigger and every row show the vault's display name
 * (`storage.vaultName`, the folder name when none is set). The filter matches the display name
 * AND the folder name (D6) — one row per vault, at its better rank.
 *
 * The keyboard model (D7): ranking is `matchLinkCandidates` over those names (the `[[` picker's
 * ranking: exact, then prefix, then substring; an empty query is MRU order), and the ranked rows
 * are then put in the two groups (YAZ-2555 A6) — a group with no match shows no label. One highlighted row;
 * with an EMPTY query it starts on the first row that is NOT the current vault — so ⌘O ⏎ jumps to
 * the last-used OTHER vault, an open one first, like ⌘Tab — with a typed query on the top row, and with no match on
 * Open folder…. ↑/↓ clamp at both ends (the `[[` picker's no-wrap rule), hover moves it too, ⏎
 * activates it — ⇧⏎ / ⇧-click open it IN this window instead, the menu's verb (YAZ-1974 D8), and
 * while ⇧ is held the highlighted row says so: "Open here" in its time slot (D9) — Esc
 * closes (the menu convention — not the search bar's two-press rule). Typing never leaves the input: rows swallow their own mousedown. "Open folder…" is not a candidate, so
 * it is visible whatever the query; a query with no vault match shows "No matching vaults" above it.
 *
 * ⌘O (D8): App bumps `openRequest`; each new value toggles the panel — opens it with the filter focused, or closes it.
 * Rows are read fresh from `storage` on every open, never cached across opens. The panel also closes
 * when its window loses focus (YAZ-2555 A4): ⌘<n> can take you to another window, and a panel left
 * up behind would show an old list. A row's menu and rename field go with it.
 *
 * Right-click (YAZ-1798): the trigger (= the current vault) and every live row open the vault
 * menu — `buildVaultMenuSections` drawn by the sidebar's own `ContextMenu`. "Open in this window"
 * is the ONE deliberate in-place switch (D8/D11); a `false` from it greys the row exactly like a
 * click's. The menu is the top layer while it stands (D4): Esc and click-away close it alone, and
 * the filter ignores ↑/↓/⏎/Esc until it is gone. Right-click never moves the highlight.
 *
 * "Set display name" (YAZ-1974 D5) turns the name into an inline field where it was right-clicked —
 * the header or the row, a `<div>` in place of the `<button>` meanwhile. ⏎ or blur saves, Esc
 * cancels, an empty field is the folder name again; the field is the top layer while it stands:
 * Esc and click-away end it alone, and a click on another row only ends it, never opens a vault.
 *
 * "Set shortcut" (YAZ-2555 D2) gives the vault a number, 1–9, in the same menu — the header's or a
 * row's: `storage.setVaultKey`, one vault per number — and the open panel's badges follow at once,
 * the one on the vault that lost the number too. "Remove from recent vaults" clears it (A2).
